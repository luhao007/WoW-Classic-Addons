About AtlasQuest:
=================

AtlasQuest is an addon for a World of Warcraft addon called Atlas.
It contains information and a list of quests for the Dungeons, Raids,
Battlegrounds and Scenarios.

AtlasQuest was originally created by Asurn in 2006.  It was updated
for the Burning Crusade expansion by Lothaer and Rabidmax.  Since July
2007 it has been maintained and updated by Thandrenn (aka Mystery8).

Over the years there have been various contributions by others.  I've
tried to make note of them in the changelog.txt where possible.

Information for AtlasQuest is gathered either first-hand in the game 
or from websites such as WoWhead.com or WoWpedia.org.
