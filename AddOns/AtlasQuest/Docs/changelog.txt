KNOWN ISSUES:
- Certain UI elements aren't displaying.  Like the bars around the quest list and the background for the Options window.
- Blue colored text is "leaking" in the quest info window.
- "Color quest titles in blue" option is not working.
- Item Comparisons are not working.
- Some coordinates and boss numbers may be off.  I'll have to go through each quest by hand and check them to see. 



Version 4.12.82  (for TBC Classic)  June 10, 2021

- Fixed: Underbog: Bring Me A Shrubbery! requires Friendly reputation.  (thanks Zilom)
- Some code cleanup work done.  Had to renumber instance numbers for Burning Crusade stuff to prevent overlap with some Vanilla stuff.  Shouldn't be visible to most people, but will prevent a problem later.  Might have fixed a bug.  Might have made a bug.  Trying to fix bugs I can't replicate is interesting.
- Added an error message if you have the wrong version of AtlasQuest installed for the current WoW version (Retail, Classic, TBC).




Version 4.12.81  (for TBC Classic)  June 3, 2021

- Atlas_ClassicWoW & Atlas_BurningCrusade are now required dependencies. 



Version 4.12.80 (for TBC Classic)  May 25, 2021

- Initial release for TBC Classic.  This is a work in progress.  

- I basically copied over the quest data from AtlaQuest 4.3.0 (Nov 25, 2008) which came out just after Lich King's release.  Hopefully its pretty accurate.  

- Included are quests that were added over the course of TBC's development, so Sunwell & Zul'Aman stuff will be in here.  

- There's a lot of bugs like missing frame elements, various options not working.  I honestly don't have the time or know-how to fix all these.  If someone else wants to hunt the bugs down and fix them, I'd be happy to merge in the edits and give credit.

- No translations yet.
