KNOWN ISSUES:
- Certain UI elements aren't displaying.  Like the bars around the quest list and the background for the Options window.
- Blue colored text is "leaking" in the quest info window.
- Item Comparisons are not working.
- Some coordinates and boss numbers may be off.  I'll have to go through each quest by hand and check them to see. 
- Some quests are going to be missing or possibly inaccurate as the quest data represents the last original WOTLK patch, 3.3.3, and may not reflect the current stage in WOTLK classic.
- Some UI bugs or features may be broken or disabled.  I no longer have the time or know-how to fix and modernize AtlasQuest and this release is being provided as a "better than nothing" sort of situation.  If anyone wants to fix the bugs I'd be happy to incorporate the fixes and provide credit.


Version 4.13.02  (for WOTLK Classic)  September 9, 2022

- German translation added for Wrath of the Lich King quests.  This translation is from Patch 3.3.3 and may be inaccurate.




Version 4.13.01  (for WOTLK Classic)  September 4, 2022

- TOC updated to 30400 for WOTLK Classic Patch 3.4.0.
- Quest data copied over from old AtlasQuest version 4.4.3, the last version before Cataclysm.
- Some quests are going to be missing or possibly inaccurate as the quest data represents the last original WOTLK patch, 3.3.3, and may not reflect the current stage in WOTLK classic.
- Some UI bugs or features may be broken or disabled.  I no longer have the time or know-how to fix and modernize AtlasQuest and this release is being provided as a "better than nothing" sort of situation.  If anyone wants to fix the bugs I'd be happy to incorporate the fixes and provide credit.
- I do not guarantee any future releases. 




Version 4.12.83  (for TBC Classic)  September 19, 2021

- "Color quest titles in blue if in questlog" option should be working.
- Updated some quest & item names that referred to Alex Afrasiabi and have been changed. 
- TOC updated for Patch 2.5.2.
- FIX: Corrected bug where quests weren't showing for anything.  Huge thanks to Flubik on CurseForge for helping.




Version 4.12.82  (for TBC Classic)  June 10, 2021

- Fixed: Underbog: Bring Me A Shrubbery! requires Friendly reputation.  (thanks Zilom)
- Some code cleanup work done.  Had to renumber instance numbers for Burning Crusade stuff to prevent overlap with some Vanilla stuff.  Shouldn't be visible to most people, but will prevent a problem later.  Might have fixed a bug.  Might have made a bug.  Trying to fix bugs I can't replicate is interesting.
- Added an error message if you have the wrong version of AtlasQuest installed for the current WoW version (Retail, Classic, TBC).




Version 4.12.81  (for TBC Classic)  June 3, 2021

- Atlas_ClassicWoW & Atlas_BurningCrusade are now required dependencies. 



Version 4.12.80 (for TBC Classic)  May 25, 2021

- Initial release for TBC Classic.  This is a work in progress.  

- I basically copied over the quest data from AtlaQuest 4.3.0 (Nov 25, 2008) which came out just after Lich King's release.  Hopefully its pretty accurate.  

- Included are quests that were added over the course of TBC's development, so Sunwell & Zul'Aman stuff will be in here.  

- There's a lot of bugs like missing frame elements, various options not working.  I honestly don't have the time or know-how to fix all these.  If someone else wants to hunt the bugs down and fix them, I'd be happy to merge in the edits and give credit.

- No translations yet.
