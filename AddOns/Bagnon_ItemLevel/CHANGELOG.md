### Added
- Now also shows the level of caged Battle Pets in your bags.

## [1.0.10] 2018-01-20

- Changed the item level fontstring to use a common frame for all my bagnon plugins as a parent, to reduce number of extra frames.

## [1.0.5] 2017-09-04
### Changed
- Moved the upgrade arrow used by Pawn farther down so it wouldn't collide with the item level display.
