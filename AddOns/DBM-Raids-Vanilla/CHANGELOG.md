- Golemagg: Fix totally screwed up timer for Falling Rocks  
    Oops, it was even clearly wrong in the test report that I guess I should read more carefully.  
- Lucifron: Fix mind control detection in SoD  
    Well, I assumed that it not triggering in the test was just a restriction of the target detection in the test. But no, it was actually broken in SoD :(
