[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/compare/r735...r736) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/releases)

- oh, bump hotfix revision. if there is any good example why that revision exists, this is it.  
- Why edit existing spellids when you can hotfix totally new ones into the game to change number of targets!  
    (This fixes alerts, icons, and say bubbles so they worka gain on bombs during Geddon)  
- Ragnaros: remove timer for second submerge on heat 1  
    This also makes the wipe test obsolete, that was just interesting because  
    of the second full submerge cycle, we'll get one on higher heat levels instead :)  
- Temple: Update Eranikus test  
    For https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/commit/14dd8b1febfedb5eec5a1778eeb9441abb91ede4  
- Add tests for Molten Core at Heat 1  
    I haven't checked the reports, don't take this is as an LGTM for all mods,  
    this is just documenting the current state of the mods.
