# MerInspect-classic-era
I want to introduce the folk version of TinyInspect Classic, designed to fix errors in the classic era.

This project was created because the current TinyInspect Classic has not been updated since 2019, and the add-on doesn't work properly in Classic.

This repo is the source code of the Curseforge Addon [MerInspect classic era](https://legacy.curseforge.com/wow/addons/merinspect-classic-era/)

The original addon is here [TinyInspect](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/itemlevel-anywhere)

UI:
- A summary widget in your character window
- A summary widget when inspecting other players

Features:
- Show character gear level
- Show character gear list with Name and Enchant
- Show character stats
- Compare character stats when inspecting other players
- Draggable window

 

Changes:
