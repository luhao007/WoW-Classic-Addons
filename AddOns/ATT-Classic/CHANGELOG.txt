1.1.9 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* When you're in a group for Naxx for Wrath Classic you'll no longer see Dedicated Few on the tooltip for boses when in a group with more than the required amount of players. Updated Glory of the Raider metas.
* The candy bucket for Tranquillien now points to Ghostlands as intended.
* Treat Bags and Handfuls of Treats were actually quite boring pre-4.2.0.
* Temporarily disabling the holiday header on the mini list.
* Fixed the azeroth meta for pre-4.2.0 clients.
