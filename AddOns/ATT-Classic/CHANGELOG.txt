0.4.9 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Updated the exclude database function.
* Common Boss Drops are now always after Zone Drops for some OCD reason.
* Quests in the database now need to use "name" instead of "title" as part of an optimization.
* AltQuestID has been purged from the addon. Optimized the Source Quest List in the Tooltips. (still need to refactor them in the pop out, but one thing at a time!) Optimized the Quest object type.
* Added full support for "isMonthly" in Classic.
* Added helper functions used in Burning Crusade zones.
* Added some extra data for the Outland files I have already.
* Saved and Collected are 2 different things.
* Reverted the collectible as cost modification other than for quests themselves until we can find an appropriate fix.
* Added Tarot Decks and Tarrot Cards.
* Spell cooldowns (such as Mooncloth CD) will now show a saved checkmark.
* Fixed the issue with quest items relative to the quest they help complete.
* Optimized the Recipe and Spell object types. As a distinction: Spells are for Headers and are naturally uncollectible. Recipes are simply collectible spells.
* Items that start quests now properly cache themselves using "itemIDAsCost".
* Fixed a bug with the recipes.
