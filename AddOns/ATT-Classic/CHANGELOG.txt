1.2.6 Release Notes
Contributions made by Crieve:
* Updated Feralas to include legacy information.
* Feralas now resides on the Retail Database.
* Fixed yet another issue with C_Map.GetPlayerMapPosition.
* Restructured the database format to allow one addon version to work for Classic, TBC, and Wrath.
* In case someone installs ATT-Classic to Retail, it should still be shown as ATT-Classic as the design is simplified.
* ATT-Classic now supports building for Cataclysm.
* ATT-Classic is once again compatible with Classic Era.
* Schematic: Steam Tonk Controller is not available until TBC.
