# AllTheThings
Do you find yourself completing old content just so that you can get literally everything for your Collections? Say no more! ALL THE THINGS will help you with your endeavor by giving you the ability to track your completion for everything.

## Features
- Supports tracking of Achievements, Quests, Appearances, Mounts, Pets, Toys, Titles, and much more.
- Primary Collections Window is moveable and resizeable.
- Auto Minilist
- Datatext Support
- Multiple Database modules to keep the addon from having to access Blizzard API.
- Filters to allow you to customize the addon to your preferences.
- Extra tooltip information (Models, Icons, Descriptions, etc).
- Fanfare music when you learn anything new.

## Release Schedule
There are two release types, alpha build and official release.
- Alpha Build
    - Released at 7:00 UTC every day.
- Official Release
    - Scheduled every Sunday.
    - Expected to be updated on the first day of any major WoW update, with frequent releases in the following days.

The git version is not a release, but it is still supported.

## Why do I need this addon?
- Ability to see what items you are missing from your collection in a more presentable means than Blizzard's UI.
- The UI has information on quests, vendors, rares, dungeons and raids, world events, and more.

## Problem? Suggestion?
If you just updated and are getting tons of errors, completely close your game and then reopen it. Updating addons while the game is running can cause problems!
