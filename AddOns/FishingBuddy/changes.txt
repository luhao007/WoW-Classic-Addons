I aplogize for those people whose options got lost -- this time I got it right! I have
no idea why the zip file didn't get uploaded last night, but the new one is good. Thank
you for your patience!

Version 0.7.8
- a very preliminary German translation
- myAddOns support
- prefs are now stored by server for each toon

The Titan panel support is still preliminary -- I want to make it default to 'on' and have a better icon. There are still things I'd like to have options for (like sorting the watch panel various ways and making it movable), but I'm going to concentrate on the outfit pieces so that they work for more situations.

Version 0.7.7

- Added Titan panel support (ugly icon, need to polish up my image skills and make a nice gold one)
- Sort the 'Fish Watcher' by name (for now)
- Added key bindings for window toggle and outfit switching
- Internal cleanups, prep for storing toon prefs by server

Auto-loot (shift right click) works for me 'as is' -- I'll have to play with key mappings to see if there's one that stops this from working...

- Add an option to leave off those pesky percentages
- Add an option to only watch the fish while you're actually fishing
- Update the version of OutfitDisplayFrame
