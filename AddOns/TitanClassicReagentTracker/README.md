# Titan Panel Classic [Reagent Tracker]

## Information
This initially started as a retrofit / continunation of the original WoW [Titan Panel Reagent Tracker](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/titan-reagents) addon by [L'ombra](https://www.curseforge.com/members/lombra/projects), maintained so that it functions for WoW Classic / TBC / etc.
Over time features have been added and the code base changed enough that it may no longer merge well with the Retail version.

## Hosting
This addon is developed and maintained via [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/cliaz/Titan-Panel-Classic-Reagent-Tracker/). Please submit issues and requests directly via GitHub.
It is mirrored on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/titan-panel-reagent-tracker) and [Wago](https://addons.wago.io/addons/titan-panel-classic-reagent-tracker), so should be accessible via both the [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com/) and [WowUp](https://wowup.io/) clients.
For what it's worth, I recommend the WowUp client.
